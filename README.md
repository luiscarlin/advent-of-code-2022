## Advent of Code 2022

My JS/ TS solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
using [Deno](https://deno.land/) as a runtime

## Get Started

```bash
# install deno (https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.1/getting_started/installation)
brew install deno

# run the solution for a day with puzzle input
deno run -A day00/day00.ts ./day00/input.txt

# run the solution for a day with sample input
deno run -A day00/day00.ts ./day00/sample1.txt

# run the tests for a day
deno test -A day00
```
